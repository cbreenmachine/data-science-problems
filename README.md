## File summaries
### labs
  Exercises from Hadley Wickham's <i> [R for Data Science Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) </i>.
### final_project
  Includes some of the code written for the final group project. My role was to build a random forest model that took a person's income level, geography, and drug consumption (marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and hallucingoenics) and predict whether they would experience suicidal thoughts. Data was collected from [SAMHDA](https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/info/browse-studies-nid3454), cleaned, and then used to build a model with ~96% accuracy in classifying individuals.
